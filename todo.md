Todo:
<!--  * Add Disqus support! (Or some other form of commenting??? IDK, look into it though!) -->
    <!-- * Maybe you need http://eviltrout.com/2014/01/22/embedding&#45;discourse.html ??? Open source option! Might be hard to install and confusing, -->
    <!-- and your already using Twitter and FB, so ethical complaints are basically out the door with Disqus. Idk, try setting -->
    <!-- up an example disqus thread! -->
    <!-- * https://github.com/simonrice/middleman&#45;disqus#important&#45;do&#45;not&#45;use&#45;real&#45;shortnames&#45;during&#45;development -->
<!--  * Make blog permalinks &#38; source folders adhere to YEAR/MONTH/title.html format! -->
<!--  * Add Twitter and Facebook share buttons! Put github, linkedin, and twitter links in your about, but a "Follow me!" -->
<!-- button would be wayyyyy too much. -->
* TODO ** Try and fiddle with styles (like article times as ids, data-attributes, or classes) to make an actual interactive calendar for all your posts!**
    * New years would automagically get a new color and be added to the calendar page, which can be achieved by the clever
styling of the elements that get generated in that calendar loop (use some sass magic with nth-child ???)
