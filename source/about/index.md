# 1. Hi, I'm Andres Cuervo!

Some people call me Andres, some call me by my last name, Cuervo, and you can
call me whichever of those you like!  If you're wondering about the domain name
vs. my last name, you can read [my blog post about
that](/thoughts/2015/08/about-the-url.html).

I'm a <span id="myAge">π</span> year old
[Latinx](http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/our-issues/why-we-say-latinx-trans-gender-non-conforming-people-explain),
[queer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer#Reclamation),
[non-binary](http://transmediawatch.org/Documents/non_binary.pdf) developer and designer
(primarily focused on educational technology and [adaptive user interface
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_user_interface)).

<script>
// From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4060004/calculate-age-in-javascript
function _calculateAge(birthday) { // birthday is a date
    var ageDifMs = Date.now() - birthday.getTime();
    var ageDate = new Date(ageDifMs); // miliseconds from epoch
    return Math.abs(ageDate.getUTCFullYear() - 1970);
}

var myBirthday = new Date(1995, 6, 12, 24, 59, 59);
document.getElementById('myAge').innerHTML = _calculateAge(myBirthday);
</script>


# 2. I Do A Lot Of Things:

I [build websites](/case-studies/)<!-- , [write](/portflio/writing.html), -->
and [do design work (web and print)](/portfolio/), mostly for non-profits and
student organizations. I also blog for [Oberlin
College](http://blogs.oberlin.edu/Andres.shtml), and maintain [a personal
blog](/thoughts/). I do at least 10 hours of community service during the
academic year at Oberlin College as a part of the [Oberlin Bonner Scholars
program](http://new.oberlin.edu/office/bonner-center/cbl-programs/bonner-scholars/),
in combination with the [Bonner Leader
program](http://new.oberlin.edu/office/bonner-center/cbl-programs/bonner-leader-program/),
both of which give me fantastic opportunites to do things relevant to my
interests and give back to the community of Oberlin.  I try to draw, write,
program, and play video games as often as I can, although I haven't been doing
much of that last activity enough lately.

# 3. I Have Experience With ...

I have a diverse skill set for building things with computers, from a formal
computer science background, to back-end and front-end engineering, to web and
digital design. See below for a breakdown of my experience with various skills,
descending by years of experience.

# 4. "Wait, wait, wait, so what's your name?"

Okay, so the short story is: my first name, last name, and readable
combinations of both my names, are mostly taken as `.com` websites.  If you
want to know more about why I chose the domain `cwervo.com`, you can read my
[blog post about it](/thoughts/2015/08/about-the-url.html).

# 5. Some Friends' Websites!

I know some people who have websites too!
