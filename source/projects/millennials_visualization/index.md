title: Millennials Visualization

<i> Most of the following information comes from the Pew Research Center's 2011
Millennial Data Set[^dataset-1], though the data used in the visualizations
below may also come from [a later data
set](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/30/a-different-look-at-generations-and-partisanship/#).

#Visualizing Millennial Opinions

The word cloud below was created from the responses of millennials[^year] to the
question “Can you tell me some ways in which your generation is unique or
distinct?” In the same survey that collected answers to that question opinions
were collected about everything from daily technology use to political
opinions.

A couple of the words have been selected (highlighted in the word cloud) and
the distributions of answers have been visualized in the charts below.
Respondents were surveyed using randomized dialing techniques, so I thought it
might be good to get a sense of just who these millennials, standing in for the
voices of an entire generation, are. Since it's anonymized, we can't get too
much data out, but we can the distribution of where they were from:

20 percent of millennial age respondents were from CA, followed by New York
state and Ohio, then a small portion of various other states.' >

## "Independent"

With a majority of moderate voters, the millennial generation seems to be less inclined to be swayed by parties. Including ‘Liberal’ and ‘Very Liberal’, this
generation also leans more heavily to the left than generations prior. (Note: this data is from a slightly different data set.[^dataset-2])

## "Technology"

Represented in the lighter color, the
millennial generation has more positive
feelings, in general, towards technology
both in how it figures into every day life
and how it affects society.
