Why, hello there!

This is eventually where I'll go into depth about past and present
websites that were especially challenging and rewarding. I'll be discussing
my redesign of the [Oberlin Book Co-op's website](http://bookcoop.org), for which
I redid the entire stack, as well as the entire design of the site. I'll
also be talking about my experience working with my first big
team over at the [Oberlin Environmental Dashboard](http://www.oberlindashboard.org).

So look forward to that!
