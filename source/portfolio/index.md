Returns null if no matches are found; otherwise, it returns the first matching element.

If the selector matches an ID and this ID is erroneously used several times in the document, it returns the first matching element.

Throws a SYNTAX_ERR exception if the specified group of selectors is invalid.

The string argument pass to querySelector must follow the CSS syntax.

CSS Pseudo-classes will never return any elements, as specified in the Selectors API

To match ID or selectors that do not follow the CSS syntax (by using a colon or space inappropriately for example), you must escape the character with a back slash. As the backslash is an escape character in JavaScript, if you are entering a literal string, you must escape it twice (once for the JavaScript string, and another time for querySelector):
