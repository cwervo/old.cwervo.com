    # Visualizations
    ["Data Visualizations",
     "February 2016 - Present",

    "My interest in data visualization began when I took an <a
    href=\"http://oberlinexco.org/\">ExCo</a> titled \"Configuring The
    Figure\". As a result of that inital experience, I have continued pursuing
    visualization by doing my creative writing capstone project as <a
    href=\"http://precipice.cwervo.com/\">an exercise in data visualization
    storytelling [in progress]</a> and am taking on a private reading in the Oberlin College
    Art department designing data visualizations for both Oberlin College and
    political topics that seem prescient in 2016. Some examples of my
    visualizations include:

    <ul>
        <li><a href=\"http://cwervo.com/projects/millennials_visualization/\">A collection of visualizations
        using Pew Center data about millenials</a></li>
        <li><a href=\"http://cwervo.com/files/standing-rock-out-of-state-police.pdf\">A visualization
        charting the early stages of out-of-state police support to the site of the Standing
        Rock protests</a></li>
    </ul>
    In addition to continued private work, I will be teaching the class I took
    last year in Spring 2017,",

    # VR.CWERVO.COM
    ["<a href='http://vr.cwervo.com'>vr.cwervo.com</a>",
     "July 2016 - Present",
     "Using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/vrview-web\">VR
     View</a> and <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">Three.js</a> I've been uploading
     some VR experiments to the web for others to play around with. I'm currently
     learning more about shaders and 3D modeling to be able to create my own scenes.
     I also hope to encorporate painting and traditional animation techniques into
     mobile VR, as I think it could be an accessible and interesting way to introduce
     people to the medium.",

    # Circle
    ["Circle CI Web Engineering Contractor",
     "June - August 2016 & January - July 2017",
     "Working with a team of full stack engineers, in close cooperation with the head of design and a product manager,
     over the course of the summer of 2016 I:
     <ul>

         <li>overhauled CircleCI's email notification system, moving from
         simple but cluttered Mustache templates to a full Clojure solution,
         making these templates more consistent, easier to understand, and
         edit in the future</li>

         <li>wrote a <a
         href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification\">web
         notifications</a> library and used it to implement notifications when
        builds on the platform are completed. Adopted by 3,000 + users on day of launch.
        </li>

         <li>created the first prototype of various user interface
         improvements; for example the image below shows both the side bar UI
         I implemented as well as a new modal interface for adding teammates
         to a project (identifying details have been blurred out)</li>

     </ul>
     I currently have a contract to work for CircleCI for the first half of 2017,
     and hope to continue working on projects that bridge design and web technologies.",

     # CodeNow
     ["CodeNow", # title
      "June 2015 - August 2015", # date

      "As an intern for the technology education non-profit CodeNow I worked
      on two distinct initiatives:

      <ul>

          <li>I revamped the curriculum website for CodeNow's first workshop, which
          teaches Ruby to high school students, by changing the underlying
          static site generator to a more sustainable option, redesigning the
          site to fit CodeNow's branding, and adding password protection</li>
          <li>working with Yvonne De La Pe√±a I helped develop a new curriculum
          for graduates of CodeNow's first workshop in which students work
          through <a
          href='https://swifteducation.github.io/teaching_app_development_with_swift/'>
          playground lessons</a> to learn the Swift programming language.
          Additionally, I built on my previous work with the Ruby website by
          adding documentation for the website, a website for
          Swift curriculum workshop tutors, and taught various members of the office how
          to use Github to update the website on their own, writing a custom
          deploy script to automate most of the process. Additionally,
          I spent some time assisting the in-person workshops, covering for tutors,
          and giving students in both Ruby and Swift workshops individual attention
          whenever they required it</li>

     # -- ART ! ---
     ["Generative Art", # title

      "Below is a screenshot of some of my generative art. Since I discovered <a href=\"https://processing.org/\">Processing</a>
      in 2012 I have been interested in making art that utilizes randomness and repitition to create interesting compositions.
