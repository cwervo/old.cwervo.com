The phrase “In Real Life” (most often abbreviated to IRL) is a strange
phrase right off the bat, isn't it? A century ago, maybe even 50, 40, 30
years ago, it would have meant nothing. To be sure, lives half a century ago
could be posh, disconnected, tragic - but, as long as you
were **alive**, you were currently 'in real life'. So first, what do we mean
when we say IRL?

As with a lot of interactions, meaning in language isn’t completely
straightforward, it’s built every time you speak to someone; usually made through
the context surrounding the conversation. On the Internet that’s a
problem, because we don’t have social cues to create context (hence
the need for [the invention of the smiley face emoticon](http://narrative.ly/stories/the-father-of-the-emoticon-chases-his-great-white-whale/)), so
necessarily my interpretation of the meaning behind IRL will be
different from yours or anyone else reading this.

IRL denotes that in digital spaces we escape the “real world” - the
world of responsibility, traditional social interaction, maybe even
traditional social graces. It is more than mere escapism, though, it denotes a
complete separation of the reality that exists between digital
interaction and physical interaction.

Except, now, we’re coming full circle, and the phrase is once again
strange, but not for any of the reasons it would have been in the past.
Today, digital existence isn’t a particularly **digital** existence, for many people it
, but especially for children born after I was, the digital sphere is simply
their mode of existence; technology for many is, to use an overwrought metaphor, like
water to a fish. That is, there is no more "artificial"
life versus “real life” - that sense of escapism has engulfed
everything ([software has eaten the world](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)),
making IRL an interesting lexical anachronism.

It’s amazing how quickly digital meaning is changing, that in someone’s
lifetime (not mine, but someone’s) an entire phrase, condensed into three little
letters, have gone from denoting an entire culture of digital awe, a true
digital subculture, to denoting an artificial boundary in a world where
that subculture has engulfed the daily, professional, and personal lives
of billions of people around the world.
