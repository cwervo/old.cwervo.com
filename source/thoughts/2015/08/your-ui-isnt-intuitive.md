**Note**: What I'm talking about here is explicitly geared toward those with a
focus on universal access to their product, not niche or business wares with
specific, pre-assumed audiences. Because it's my area of interest, I'm
particularly focusing on how this affects EdTech, but this applies to any any
area where you want as many people as possible to be able to interact with your
product.

Outline:

* 'Digital Native' informs our current understanding of young users, and a
peripheral understanding that technology is virtually ubiquitous informs our
understanding of users generally.
    * This is bullshit, and even kids today can't be assumed to have
    'digitally native' experiences, that is, access (**need links**) or, for
    those with access to technology, unfettered personal access in the same way
    a middle income teenager might (**need links**) .
    * Can we also take a moment to recognize that this terminology
    places immigration as an inherently other-ing experience, a label from
    which people (including disadvantaged youth and anyone who grew up before
    the rise of the commercial Internet) must always play catch-up. This is not
    only ignorant of the experiences of immigrants and their ability to
    contribute to the nations they immigrate to, it's also incredibly
    appropriative of an experience that has produced trauma for millions,
    especially in the United States.
* So what are some things we assume about our users when we understand them as
digital natives, or as well-adjusted digital immigrants? Well, a few small
examples might be:

## Icons
* Icons like the o-so-popular hamburger menu or the save icon. [Icons are
inherently inaccessible](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/),
and while you can assume that [2/3rds of you American adult users have a
smartphone](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/)
what about that last 1/3rd? What about the users who are and will have to
get used to mobile interfaces as smartphone market penetration rises - who
don't have familiarity with these icons? You can assume anything you want
about your users' iconographic fluency, but if you really want to make sure
everyone knows what every piece does, just write it out.

## Keyboard accessibility (it's a double edged sword).
* On one hand, if someone can't navigate something without the use of a
keyboard, it can be [a complete
disaster](http://www.webaxe.org/apples-inaccessibility/). On the other hand,
if you

The terms "digital native" and "digital immigrant" still informa a lot of how we
design - even when the man who coined those terms now [disagrees with them
](http://marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky-Intro_to_From_DN_to_DW.pdf). First,
what the hell are we talking about when we use the terms digital "immigrant"
and "native"? Well, if we go by the authors of "Born Digital: Understanding
The First Generaton of Digital Natives", we get this foggy definition:

> They were all born after 1980, when social digital technologies, such as
Usenet and bulletin board systems, came online. They all have access to
networked digital technologies. And they all have the skills to use those
technologies.  (Except for the baby—but she’ll learn soon enough.)

I'm certain that in 1980 the sentence "they **all** have access to networked
digital technologies" wasn't a true statment, but the problem is we're acting
as though, after three decades of expansion, that sentence is somehow now true.
We still use the rhetoric of digital natives because we find it convenient to
understand anyone born after the 1980s as a big group we can target off
shared knowledge. Unfortunately, the digital revolution was never about equality,
and in the last 35 years that part hasn't changed.

There's been a lot of excitement over the concept of digital natives versus the
old generations, "digital immigrants," as it were. Beside the fact that this
implies immigration is a narrative of catching-up to the inborn, superior,
"natives", this terminology has very real effects on how we design things, and
it'll hold us back, as an industry, back from making the widest possible
change in people's, but especially children's, lives.

There are a few things you can assume all kids will be familiar with in your
new app, right? Like, icons:

* The save icon (even kids who don't know what a floppy disc is know what it
looks like, because they use computer's every day!)
* The "hamburger button," an o-so popular mobile design icon that now shows
up in both mobile and desktop interfaces.
* Keyboard shortcuts - because everybody has the ability to use keyboards like
a long-fingered computer whiz.
* I could go on and on.

We take a lot of these things for granted (I know I do, every day), because
these elements are ubiquitous to our lives. But the things is, there are still
people who don't have regular, intimate access to computers or the latest
mobile technology. When **some percentage, find statistics for this** of kids
come into a class room and have to deal with an interface that has symbols
they don't inherently recognize, you're going to have a much tougher time
getting that kid to use your app as their main means of education.

Digital natives exists, but just like we're learning to reject the idea that
tech is a meritocracy, that everyone can make it if they just "work hard
enough", we need to unlearn the idea that every child is a digital native, and
that every adult has a smartphone, or for even those who do have access to
these technologies, that they use their technology as intimately and
consistently as tech advertisements would have you believe. Software is eating
the world, sure, but the keyword in that phrase is "**is**", meaning present
tense. Software hasn't eaten the world completely, and it definitely hasn't
done so evenly across populations. We have to remember that accessibility isn't
just a feature or a goal - if you want to have an impact in the world, you
should be designing, build, and testing around every use case, designing
interfaces that adapt to levels of comfortability and experience with technologies,
building technologies that work as far down the stack as possible.
