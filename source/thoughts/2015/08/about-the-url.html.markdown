First of all, if you're reading this in August 2015 - how exciting! That means
my site just launched for the first time, and this is my first blog post! Okay,
enough exclamation points (for now), on to the story:

---
The domain for this website, cwervo.com, comes from a Facebook status I made
last month:

> V and U [used to be the same
letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U#Related_letters_and_other_similar_charac
ters) (I'm using uppercase so you can see it without the terminal on in "u"),
"V". Have you ever noticed W is "double u"?  That's because it's two archaic U
shapes ("V") next to each other: "VV" (double u) ~= "W" ("doubleyoo"). Anyway,
the reason I've been thinking about this for a while is: my last name is
popular around the world and presents problems for getting unique usernames and
email addresses and identifiers like that.  Phonetically "Cuervo" is similar,
if not equivalent to, "Cwervo" and the morphological relationships between the
two characters is really cool too, as shown above.
======== BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE =========
"quervo" is phonetically similar (again, if not equivalent) AND a
rough morphological derivative of "cuervo":  
c u e r v o (regular)  
c| u e r v o (put a descending [I can't type a descending bar] bar next to "c")  
q u e r v o (squish the bar with the "c" and you have this!)  
So. I've been thinking about
that instead of doing the mountain of homework I have. Anway. I'll get back to
that now.

_Aside: If you're wondering, I **did** do my homework on time that night. And, yes, I
post egregiously lengthy thoughts like that to Facebook a lot. That's partially
why this blog exits! Hopefully this will be a place where I'll have more room
to write without overloading people's feeds, and  a better record of all my
late night ideas that never get thought about again._

So, why did I end up picking cwervo over quervo? Well, I guess the simplest reason is
that I like the morphology of cwervo more. But there are two other reasons:

## 1. It's Closer, Morphologically, To 'Cuervo'

If you look at the example below, you can see what I meant when I said above
that 'W' came out of 'U'. Basically, just take a modern day 'U' and bend the middle
of it upward, and you have the shape of a 'W'! While I'm probably the only
person who cares about this, it still gives me satisfaction to know that
this domain name has this relation to my given name.

## 2. Easier To Associate With 'Cuervo'

The second reason I went with cwervo is that it's more closely related to my
given name. 'Cuervo' looks more like, and is more lexically related to,
'cwervo' than 'quervo' is. I think this is interesting because they vary in
only one letter, and I can make the case that quervo is morphologically related
to cuervo, but ultimately the starting 'q' just throws the whole word into a
very different place. I'd venture to say some of this is due to the baseline
disruption the 'q' introduces to the word: all on the same baseline, 'cuervo'
and 'cwervo' simply look and '_feel_' more related, to me anyway.
