I'm treating this post like a journal, at least on the first day I'm writing
this: 11:50AM Friday, Feb. 26<sup>th</sup>. My current Pocket backlog totals
1,730 articles. If you're interested in how I got to this point, where I even
find so much to read and save, [I talked about that
before](cwervo.com/thoughts/2016/02/finding-good-reads.html).

Anyway, here's my plan:

- give myself a generous *under*-estimate of the number of articles I'll save in the coming year: about 300.
- cool, with that underestimate, let's say I have 2000 articles to read in the next 365 days
- 2000 / 265 = ~5.47
- So, rounding up, I'll need to read 6 articles in my Pocket a day.

And that's it, that the plan on this snowy February day in 2016: read about 6
things a day for the next 365 days. I mean, that _sound_ great, but how am I
going to keep myself accountable? Well, I'm going make a recurring reminder to
myself to read at least that many articles a day, every day. Additionally, so I
can see how much I've been reading, I'll be keeping track of what and how much
I read a day. Let's hope it works!

Alright, day two, but I was brushing my teeth and I came up with a new plan,
one that I have been thinking about since yesterday, but couldn't quite
formulate. I'm going to use the amazing [Read Ruler](http://readruler.com/) to
help me out. Read Ruler tags all your articles in your Pocket with estimated
reading times based on your reading speed; I'm going to use this feature to
churn through my backlog in my free time by reading all 1 minute, then 2, 5, 10
minute, etc. articles so I can maximize my reading time with my goal of getting
through this backlog. I guess I'm sort of taking a page from the way some
people [pay off credit card
debt](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/dave-ramsey-vs-suze-orman-which-plan-for-dealing-with-debts-is-best/)?
