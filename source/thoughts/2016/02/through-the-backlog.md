# February 26, 2016

I'm treating this post like a journal, at least on the first day I'm writing
this: 11:50AM Friday, Feb. 26<sup>th</sup>. My current Pocket backlog totals
1,730 articles. If you're interested in how I got to this point, where I even
find so much to read and save, [I talked about that
before](cwervo.com/thoughts/2016/02/finding-good-reads.html).

Anyway, here's my plan:

- give myself a generous *under*-estimate of the numebr of articles I'll save in the coming year: about 300.
- cool, with that underestimate, let's say I have 2000 articles to read in the next 365 days
- 2000 / 265 = ~5.47
- So, rounding up, I'll need to read 6 articles in my Pocket a day.

And that's it, that the plan on this snowy February day in 2016: read about 6
things a day for the next 365 days. I mean, that _sound_ great, but how am I
going to keep myself accountable? Well, I'm going make a recurring reminder to
myself to read at least that many artciles a day, every day. Additionally, so I
can see how much I've been reading, I'll be keeping track of what and how much
I read a day. Let's hope it works!
